Acceptance & Frustration
It is generally argued that 'acceptance' leads to apathy; in the context of DevOps that is deemed to equate to inaction and will make even a mild DevOps practitioner cringe.

===

## Acceptance

In the DevOps community it is a common mantra to "accept nothing as-is; continually push the boundaries in all cases". While _generally_ a sound approach to improvement, it isn't always the best way forward and can be a significant contributor to frustration. Especially when running up against forces outside of your control.

What triggered me to think about acceptance was a statement that I ran across in a forum (unrelated to DevOps):
> "If you're not prepared to accept how it works you will only find frustration."

For just a moment, hold off that urge to cringe and think about that statement: _"If you are not prepared to accept how it works, you will only find frustration"_.

The natural inclination is to [mis]interpret this as a path to apathy/a blocker of continous improvement. Instead, understanding what this statement says is more powerful than a push forward at all costs mentality. It empowers one to focus on those things that they **can** change rather than being caught up with trying to change _everything_ and getting frustrated when those attempts fall short. This subtle mindset shift is powerful...the first part of that quote is the key: "If you're not prepared to accept...". This doesn't mean you shouldn't push for change. On the contrary; it instead empowers you to try and, if the intended change meets an insurmountable wall (for now), accept it and move on. You can always try again later when there is less resistance and greater trust has been established.

> Change is good when done right!

## Frustration

Spending cycles beating your head against a wall is unproductive and, worse, detrimental to mental wellbeing (both of the individual and team). It is this very thing that the quote above speaks to; that one must be prepared to accept "how things work" no matter the context.

> "If you're not prepared to accept how it works you will only find frustration."

It's okay if accepting doesn't equate to liking; more often than not, you won't like when you have to accept "the way it is" as you likely felt strongly about some change that you were hoping for. The alternative is to feed the frustration which can kill all aspects of productivity beyond what the true source is. Is that worth it?

## Picking Your Battles

Accepting everything 'as-is' doesn't help make progress. Nor is accepting nothing as it is. Rather, picking the _right_ battles is one of the most important skills that true leaders excel at. Not every "the way it is" is worth spending capital to fight and will undoubtedly work against those who insist of carrying a zero (or negative) balance of capital. Those who "fight everything" will eventually find their voice ignored. And that is a true loss to both individual and the Organization they are part of.

> "Those who "fight everything will eventually find their voice ignored."

The art of picking your battles balances change for change's sake and encouraging moving forward for those "causes" that _really_ matter; those changes that truly _make a difference_. Making a difference drives lasting change.

## Change Is Good

Ignoring change, accepting the status quo can work for while, until that disrupter comes along (and it **will** come). But forcing change simply to change leads to self-disruption. Change needs to have purpose, measurable benefit and acceptance. In that context, nudging those resistent to change is healthy. But remember, "if you are not prepared to accept how it works you will only find frustration". So be prepared to step back, assess and pick the right battle.

Change is good when done right.
