Dropping In!

There are times when something can be frightening, and yet, you just need to jump-in with both feet. Afterward, when you come out the other side, you'll \[usually\] be glad you did...

===

Being a cautious personality type, _dropping in_ to totally new things is way outside of my comfort zone. This isn't to say that I avoid new experiences outright; rather, measured risk is better suited to me.

Realization of the value of _dropping in_ hits at different times; usually **after** you've embarked upon a frightening event. I was recently reminded of this while on a snowboarding trip to Powder Mountain and Park City. Day 1 and 2 at Powder Mountain were amazing with a number of small _dropping in_ events sprinkled throughout both days (chasing my more experienced snowboarding friends through the trees and floating over the deepest powder I've ever seen, for example).

> The it struck; a significant _dropping in_ moment...

Day 3 at Park City was underwhelming leading into Day 4 where I had convinced myself would be an 'easy' day to wrap up a great trip. Then it struck; a significant _dropping in_ moment. It went something like this...
* __Experienced snowboarding friend #1__: "Take a look at that face, it's virtually untouched!"
* __Experienced snowboarding friend #2__: "That does look nice, I wonder what the hike-in is like?"
* __Me__: Looks crazy steep; I'm out!
* _continued ride up the chair; #1 and #2 scouting the target area... We ride back down where #1 and #2 discuss the hike with a local... Back on the chair..._
* __Me__: Don't even ask; I'm out!
* __\#2__: The hike-in is easy, 10-15 minutes at most.
* __\#1__: We're doing it, why not?
* __Not very experienced skiing friend #3__: Ah, I don't know about this.
* _hop off the chair, I'm ready to head another way...reminding myself it's supposed to be an "easy" day._
* __\#1__: Where are you going? Get back here!
* __\#3__: If you go, I'll go.
* __Me__: I don't know about this... Maybe I'll check it out, though (I can always bail).
* _the hike was made in contemplative silence; hardly even a 10 minute walk... Now I'm looking over the edge of a cliff!_
* __Me__: _Silent contemplation_
* __\#3__: I'm ready to walk back; looks to be out of my league
* (before I can respond) __#1__: You are **NOT** bailing!
* __Me__: _...Continued silent contemplation..._
* _a few minutes pass; yep, I've made up my mind, I'm going to bail..._
* __Me__: We better go....now....before I change my mind! **DROPPING IN!!**

> _Dropping in_ can be frightening but, usually, it's so very worth it in the end.

Was it pretty? Nope, not in the least... :) But it **was** exhilarating! It **was** way outside of my comfort zone. It **was** an opportunity that, having _dropped in_, hindsight tells me that I'd have been totally bummed out if I had bailed.

The moral? _Dropping in_ can be frightening but, usually, it's so very worth it in the end. Now I have a memory for the rest of my life and looking over the edge of that next cliff might not be so far outside of my comfort zone.

**Don't miss out on that next opportunity to _drop in_.**
