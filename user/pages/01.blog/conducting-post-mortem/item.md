Coordinating a Learning Review

Running an effective, blameless learning review is a critical skill of an SRE. At it's core, these learning reviews (a.k.a. Post Mortem) strive to identify how an Organization can improve; to identify behaviors to build upon and behaviors to avoid. With that mindset, a learning review is a very effective tool.

===

## The Ideal Learning Review
Ideally, an effective learning review is held as soon as possible after the event. The more time that passes; details become fuzzy and less helpful.

## Coordinating A Learning Review

#### Participants
There was a major incident and a lot of interest to discuss what happened! If the Organizational climate is good, this is a great situation to have. Finding the right balance of participants is nearly as important as the timing; too few and you may not have the **right** folks in the room. Too many; there's risk of veering off-topic and theorizing too much about what occurred.
> Management is notorious for wanting to be involved... That's both good and bad; usually leaders have the technical background to contribute to root cause analysis. However, managers can be a key champion for acquiring resources when needed and often they ask questions that technical folks tend to overlook when digging deep in the weeds.

Who to include; some general guideline:
1. The key individuals directly involved with incident identification and resolution
2. Subject matter experts (especially if one of these SME's wasn't involved with the initial identification and resolution)
3. Junior team members (at most a few); mainly as observers to learn from the incident / learn about the learning review process at your Organization
  * Helpful to show critical thinking process
  * Models desired behavior
4. When key decisions are anticipated to be needed, invite those individual that can make decisions in real-time

#### Format
Ideally, your Organization has a general template to follow. Having a template is helpful to keep participants focused and to build a common understanding for recording metrics and outcomes.
> While having a template is not critical (and some would argue that it's potentially limiting) having one helps drive the conversation, establishes a pattern and is a consistent way to record the data for future review

#### Goals
Continual improvement is the primary goal of a learning review. This is an opportunity to examine an incident, collaborate and share ideas about how to improve and transparency within the Organization.
> Transparency is a key element of a learning review. Sharing the incident, actions taken during and outcomes to help avoid in the future can be useful outside of the immediate team. Sharing enables the entire Organization to learn and fosters a safe and continual learning environment...

Secondary goals feeding continual improvement include:
* Collaboration; including others builds morale and fosters sharing of ideas
* Education; ideas that an individual may not have thought about are discussed, expanding upon individual knowledge
* Builds a sense of comradery within and across teams; what better way to come together than a shared critical event!

## After The Learning Review

#### Follow-up
Nearly all learning reviews generate "next step" tasks assigned to various individuals. These follow-up items are the catalysts to Organizational improvement:
> Without identifying where we can do better, the next similar event is waiting to happen

Therefore, assigning and *following up* on those assignments are perhaps the second most important aspect of any learning review. This follow-up must be owned by the Product Team(s) involved, not some outside/governing body. That approach, owned by a disjointed individual/team, disempowers the Product Team and builds an unnecessary outside dependancy.

#### Transparency
Publishing learning review summaries is an important aspect of organizational learning. Inviting others to read, comment and learn from incidents reinforce the culture of continuous learning. Further, doing so builds accountability.

##### Thoughts on format
While not very glamourous, using templates for running and recording learning reviews is a powerful way to drive evangelizing the practice within an Organization. This encourages less skilled facilitators to run effective Learning Reviews, gaining experience and futher teaching the Organization about this important practice of continued learning.

Having consistency across learning reviews is helpful for running them more efficiently; participants learn what to expect and review of the documentation becomes easier to digest. This does not/should not equate to a stagnant Learning Review template! It also must evolve and adapt _with_ the Product Teams to remain useful.

#### Seeking Feedback
You've facilitated the learning review, you've published the findings and have assigned tasks to follow-up on; but your work isn't yet complete! Facilitators must seek feedback from participants and review the documentation in order to hone their skill. This implies that formats (both for conducting and documenting) may change; that is okay, desired even. Just like responding to events, we want to continually evolve our learning review practice. Obtaining feedback is how we achieve continual improvement.

## The Bottom Line
Continuous improvement, evolution, maturity...whatever you choose to call it, a Learning Review is just a tool to help facilitate it. It's not meant to be a rigid, exhaustive process because if it turns into that, it is no longer useful. I don't believe that Learning Reviews should be things that are "required". Rather, their merit is what compels teams to use them. True; if an Organization doesn't yet use them some nudging/coaching is necessary. Beyond that, if adoption needs to be forced, perhaps the Organization just isn't yet ready.
