Where will this journey lead?

===

I'm a generally curious individual (which is a critical trait for someone in IT) and ran across Grav while dabbling with WordPress. My goal wasn't to setup a WordPress site, but to learn more about the software in relation to a few sites that my Organization hosts internally. And heck, WordPress drives a massive chunk of the web, so, exploring it made sense!

Nor was my goal to start a blog. Sure, like many I've thought about starting one but what contribution can I make? What unique information do I have to share that isn't already shared in the millions of other blogs out there?

My research lead to stumbling upon Grav. What is Grav? Their description says it best:

> Grav is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible file-based Web-platform. There is Zero installation required. Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running. Although Grav follows principles similar to other flat-file CMS platforms, it has a different design philosophy than most.

I was intrigued.

- [x] Simple setup?
- [x] Quick/easy content management?
- [x] Fast (on my slow-ish, but cheap, hosting provider)? I'm in!

But sometimes, it isn't about the destination (such as, a highly trafficked and wildly useful blog) but rather the journey. In my case, a journey of learning which I believe a blog can help with. How?

1. By providing focus on a topic
2. By standing up/maintaining the underpinning software
3. Perhaps, at some point, the conversations that start as a result of information that I choose to share

So here it is, a start... Where will this journey lead?
