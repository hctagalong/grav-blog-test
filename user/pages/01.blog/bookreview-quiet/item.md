Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is an interesting read. I stumbled across Mrs. Cains' [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts) and was immediately intrigued...

===

She's a captivating speaker; her [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts) is well worth the watch. Wanting to learn more I picked up her book and dug in.

What I had expected was a read about how corporate America has gone crazy; open seating plans, valuing the loudest speakers (you know, "the squeaky wheel gets the grease"), and believing that those who talk most are the best and brightest. Instead, what I found was an insightful exploration about the psychology of introverts and extroverts.

Mrs. Cain dives into various studies and theories from multiple Psychologists driving to explain how these (Introvert vs. Extrovert) personality types are different. It isn't about one verses the other, instead it's how one can recognize the differences to better understand how to get the best from you.

A section that resonated with me from the a chapter discussing when should you act more extroverted than you really are:
> It's not always so easy, it turns out, to identify your core personal projects. And it can be especially tough for introverts, who have spent so much of their lives conforming to extroverted norms that by the time they choose a career, or a calling, it feels perfectly normal to ignore their own preferences

"Perfectly normal to ignore their own preferences"... While this doesn't necessarily equate to not enjoying what I do, it shines a light on why, at times, feelings of detachment is common. Mrs. Cains' advice to find ones' core personal project:
* "First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. ... You may have known more about who you were then than you do now"
* "Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to"
* "Finally, pay attention to what you envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth"

Another illuminating discussion point relates to how introverts can best get along in our extroverted culture; find restorative niches throughout the day. Understanding that introverts draw energy from quiet, this is vitally important to perform at their peak.

Overall; I found "Quiet: The Power of Introverts In a World That Can't Stop Talking" insightful. Because it dives into psychological theory, I wouldn't say that it was a quick read. Further, there are some chapters that weren't necessarily relevant to me.

Bottom line; I'd recommend it only to those that have an interest in personality psychology or to understand introverts.
