What the hell were we thinking?

My wise father-in-law was fond of saying "what the hell where you thinking" when, well, you did something that he believed was.....stupid. What about when __you__ believe you did something stupid? What should *that* be filed under?

===

What is it that I believe was stupid? We brought home a new puppy on the 26th, that's what!

How stupid? Here's some bullet points:
* Already have a resident Golden that's 3.5yrs old; super easy to deal with, pretty much on auto-pilot now and loves being the center of ALL attention
* Puppies are a ton of work; memories fade, especially of the "hard" stuff. How quickly we forgot the trials of having a puppy in your midst
* I have reservations about the breeder, and we used her for a second time
* Did I mention that puppies are a lot of work?

##### Our Resident Golden
Sage, our resident Golden, is a sweetheart. She's primarily a people animal, doesn't much care about other canines... She's not aggressive towards them (not most, anyway) but seems to prefer humans. How is this a problem? Well, she is, I believe, too tolerant of the "interloper". When she has a toy, Willow (a.k.a. the Interloper) will grab it and the big dog just lets it go. Too sweet; she should just haul off on the puppy and establish chain of command! Yes; her behavior is better than the alternative, which, if I'm honest, is exactly what I thought was going to happen. It's tough to see her roll-over like that -- come on, Sage!

##### Puppies = Ton of work
No question, a 8-9week old puppy is challenging. You get little "free" time, little sleep and little relaxation. These little buggers need a lot of attention! This is easy (too easy) to forget after a short period of time. If you can believe it, you *actually* wish that they were puppies again -- how ludicrous! That is, until you get another one and then it turns into a series of "what the hell was I thinking" moments.

What's funny is that Newman and I made statements like:
> I don't remember taking Sage out as much as Willow -- did we really go outside this much?

The answer was, of course, 'yes'. I had found the start of a housetraining spreadsheet we started to use for Sage. Sure enough, yup, it *was* that much!

Another statement, a personal favorite:
> Sage wasn't **this** much work / this wild!

Ha! I'll bet she was... Puppies are simply a lot of work, and wild, and crazy, and totally frustrating!

##### Our Breeder
Well, this one is definitely a "what the hell was I thinking" sort of thing. We had a lot of intestinal trouble with Sage (a nasty little parasite named giardia) that took literally months to straighten out (I think it was near 6 months, but my memory has faded). The breeder will deny it, but I am convinced that it can be traced back to her living conditions of the animals -- too many big dogs and too many (far too many) puppies. While she does seem to be a humane/kind person, her breeding practices are very questionable. I won't go so far as asserting that she's operating a puppy mill, but she's certainly making some poor decisions.

I vowed to not buy another puppy from that breeder again. As fate would have it, we did. And guess what; same problem with Willow. Ugh!
> Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!

Have I learned my lesson about this particular breeder? That is an unequivocal "yes"! I won't recommend her nor buy another puppy from her again. While I adore our sweet Sage, I can't in good conscious go to her again and reward her practices.

While I won't give the name of this breeder; if  asked directly, I'd recommend to find another. You might pay more, you might have to wait, you might have many more restrictions on how you live with your puppy (i.e. *many* breeders require a physical fenced-in yard), but ultimately you will start out with a healthier puppy.

##### The Next Chapter?
How is Willow working out? It hasn't yet been a week, but she's sweet, and cuddly, and funny... She's settling into our home and routines. We are finding her particularly challenging for crate training; much more carrying on than I remember with Sage or our pervious Golden. We continue to take slow/small steps; in time it'll work out. The journey has just started... Buckle up!
